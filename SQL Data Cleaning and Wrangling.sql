--  When deleting duplicates we will consider only the entries that have the same Brand, Product_Name, Product_Price, and Total_reviews.
--  We will not consider Purchases_in_past_month because if 2 rows have the same information for each column but different purchases_in_past_month
--this would imply a different shop selling the product. As well, if 2 rows have the same amount of total_reviews, price, and product name this
--would also imply that when using the python web scraper we grabbed 2 of the same posts for running shoes. Redudent data, that can skew results.
-- We will be considering Brand because some products of certain brands carry generic product names like "Men's running shoe", this product name could apply to multiple brands.
