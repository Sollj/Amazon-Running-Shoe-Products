## About Dataset

### Data Extraction Process

Gathered the first 20 pages products from Amazon for best selling running shoes and trail running shoes for men and women. 
This means 80 webpages of product data were downloaded for the best selling (trail) running shoes. 
Webpages were downloaded into HTML format and ran through a python web scraper to extract important quantitative and qualitative data points (Data Glossary contains more details).
